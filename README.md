# daddy-jokes
A dad joke is a short joke, typically a pun, presented as a one-liner or a question and answer, but not a narrative. Generally inoffensive, dad jokes are stereotypically told with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to their overly-simplistic humor.
<br>
Many dad jokes may be considered anti-jokes, deriving humor from an intentionally not funny punchline.
<br>
A common type of dad joke goes as follows: A child will say to the father, "I'm hungry," to which the father will reply, "Hi, Hungry, I'm Dad."
<br>
